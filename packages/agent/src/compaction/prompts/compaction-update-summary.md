Update existing handoff summary in <previous-summary> tags from new messages above for another LLM to resume.

MUST:
- preserve all previous-summary information; add new progress, decisions, context.
- Progress: move completed "In Progress" items to "Done".
- update "Next Steps" for completed work.
- preserve exact file paths, function names, error messages.
- MAY remove irrelevant content.
- If new messages end with an unanswered user question/request: add it to Critical Context; replace any previous pending question if answered.
- output only the structured summary; NEVER extra text.
- keep sections concise. Code maintains `<read-files>`, `<modified-files>`, and `<ledger>`; focus on intent, decisions, findings, failed approaches, and next steps.
- include mentioned repository state changes (branch, uncommitted changes).
